This is a simple web application to demonstrate the use of IP address, Subnet, Port, TCP, HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, UDP, DNS, DHCP.


## IP Address
```bash
http://
```
# Pupose of IP Address
  Identifying a device 192.168.1.2
  Location of a device
    Network of a device
    Host of a device
    Interface of a device
    Router of a device
There are two types of IP
    IPv4: 
        32 bit address and 4 octets
        192.168.1.2 each part octet is 8 bit

    IPv6: 
        128 bit address
        2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334  each part is 16 bit

# Subnet
    there two most important components of subnet
        1. subnet mask: 
            The subnet mask is a 32-bit number that masks an IP address, 
            and divides the IP address into network address and host address.
        2. subnet ID:
            A subnet ID is a portion of an IP address that identifies a specific network on an IP-based network. 
            Subnetting is the process of creating new networks by dividing an existing network into smaller network segments.

    192.168.1.2/24 
        24 is the subnet mask
        192.168.1.100 is the subnet ID

    255.255.255.0 is the subnet mask
    24 bit is the subnet mask in binary 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
    24 bit convert to binary 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

    each bit denote 2 power n where n is the position of the bit from right to left
    2^7 2^6 2^5 2^4 2^3 2^2 2^1 2^0
    128  64  32  16  8   4   2   1

    192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254

# port: 8080 
    it is door like structure in a computer
    it is a 16 bit number
    it is used to identify the application
    it is used to identify the service

    port range 0 to 65535
    0 to 1023 are well known ports
    1024 to 49151 are registered ports
    49152 to 65535 are dynamic ports

    They are used by system processes that provide widely used types of network services.

#TCP:
    Transmission control protocol
    it is a connection oriented protocol
#HTTP:
    Hyper text transfer protocol
    it is a application layer protocol
    it is used to transfer the data over the web
#HTTPS:
    Hyper text transfer protocol secure
    it is a secure version of HTTP
    it is used to transfer the data over the web
#FTP:
    File transfer protocol
    it is used to transfer the file over the network
#SMTP:
    Simple mail transfer protocol
    it is used to send the email
#UDP:
    User datagram protocol
    it is a connection less protocol
DNS:
    Domain name system
    it is used to convert the domain name to IP address
#DHCP:
    Dynamic host configuration protocol
    it is used to assign the IP address to the device
